### Origin of Name
Because the Snuffleupagus probably isn't real. But then, maybe it is. It cannot be proven
that the Snuffleupagus does not, in fact, exist; only, that it does, if it does.

(ironically, too hard to spell)

Coming Soon:

* Yeti -- still unsure as to what exactly it will do but it is clearly another name in need of assignment to a subproject
